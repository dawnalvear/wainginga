Hi, I want to analyze multiples tracks in Ableton Live, and I wanna use Voxengo SPAN Plus because I love his spectrum (as opposed to the MMultiAnalyzer, shitty spectrum to me).

Hello I recently learned about the spectrum analyser Voengo Span. I'm under the impression you can set it up in such a way as to view realtime spectrum analysis from multiple tracks, but i'm really confused as to how to achieve this despite reading the manual and trying to implement some vague suggestions in forums that weren't very Ableton specific when searching for more details on line. The closest I achieved was holdin a snapshot of one track whilst hearing another but lost it again as thoug. I see tutorials online for setting up multi channel routing in FL Studio but I can't seem to find anything to shed light on this for Pro Tools.

Hiya, I'm trying to find a download for the Voxengo Span analyzer but their site seems to be down :( Has anyone got a copy of the files I could grab from a dropbox link or something? Their site: Cheers. Если вы только начинаете изучать анализ звука, то в Voxengo SPAN поставьте значения как на рисунке ниже, это облегчит изучение. I'm wanting to use this plugin as the visuals and response seems nicer than stock, but it caps out at -18db. I can change this to 0db, but it adjusts everything 18db quieter. which renders being able to change that useless. I'm double checking it against the spectrum analyzer i've always used: Ableton's stock one. For instance, a sub is hitting -35db on Voxengo, compared to Ableton's spectrum analyzer saying its -10db. It's definitely hitting at -10db, I mean come on, it's a mastered track. 
Voxengo SPAN v3.2: SPAN - анализатор спектра, работающий в реальном времени и использующий алгоритм. I'm trying to setup multi-track routing into Voxengo Span but only see 2 inputs (left/right).

I recently downloaded and played around with SPAN, and having that visualization has helped me make a huge amount of progress in a very short time. Before, I couldn't really tell what was going on in the very low end of my mixes, but now I can listen to a bass without even having SPAN open and know what frequencies are the main ones. It's really helped me make connections between what's going on and what I hear. What other plugins out there also have visualizations? I'm not just wondering about.

So I was surprised that firstly a white noise didn't make a straight line, and found settings in most of them to adjust the slope. So it may be obvious to those in r/audioengineering that 0db / octave is flat with whitenoise, and pink noise is 3db / octave. Then I tried my favorite plugin Voxengo SPAN, and was suprised that by default was 4.5db / octave.

Hey guys.Here are some techniques for getting your kick to "pop through" the mix a bit more: Worth noting: Sound selection is key.

Disclaimer I have been producing for 5 years and currently use Voxengo SPAN as a spectrum analyzer My problem is that even though my mix sounds good (i.e. there are no clashing frequencies and a good distribution of bass/general music) the spectrum analyzer shows that I am lacking low-mid to low frequencies.

I'm using Voxengo Span for metering stuff, and I'm just wondering how you guys like to use the information in that or similar plug-ins. Like it includes Crest Factor    what values are good for that?

Hi, amp#x200B; I'd like to assume that I'm a fairly advanced Techno Producer (been doing this for more or less 6 years), yet I kinda have trouble 'mixing' in key. amp#x200B; In the end, nothing really has to be in the same key, if it sounds good. The "just go with what sounds good" thing doesn't really work for me though - I find it quite difficult to match the key of really deep Kicks, Subs, Basses and sometimes even deep Percussion elements. I can see how it works with HiHats though. I have a problem where when using voxengo span analyser there is too much high end (aiming for a relatively flat spectrum), yet when I turn up the bass elements to counter this they then stick out too much and are far too loud, despite the analyser now being flatter. Does anyone have any solutions to this? Thanks I am using FL Studio 20. I am using voxengo's Span plugin. I am trying to make sure I reduce gain to create room for my noises/frequencies. I am trying to aim for 6 DBFM (decibels) below 0. FL Studio's Mixer shows my mix very close to 0. Span shows my master closer to -6. So, use this image to see what I mean and please let me know, am I actually close to 0, or do I have -6? https://ibb.co/jkodpp. In a previous tutorial I did an overview of spectrum analysis using the free plugin from Voxengo called Span https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_m1H. A bit of background, I'm using Izotope Ozone 8 to master and a bunch of other compression which I toned down the dry/knob. I'm using Levels and Voxengo Span to monitor the loudness of my song. I stumble into a problem: which one is more important for loudness, LUFS or RMS? I've seen many websites saying that LUFS is more important because "RMS only using math to determine the loudness of a song, whereas LUFS is a 'perceived hearing' of listeners, which makes it better for determining VST GRATIS VOXENGO SPAN FREE DOWNLOAD e INSTALLAZIONE LINK DOWNLOAD: Lascia subito un MI PIACE e un COMMENTO: il vostro.
