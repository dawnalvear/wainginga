                            <p> Since updating to 7.1.1, My Xperia X has been facing a lot of battery drain when the phone is idle. It is always above 30%. I first thought it woud be h/w issue but after some research I found that many people are facing this problems on recent Xperia phones after the new update. This has further reduced the battery life of my phone which was not ideal already. Has anyone found a solution/work around for this problem. It was a comment, possibly on /r/sonyxperia, where someone was complaining about the Movie Creator on their phone. It had automatically made a video compilation using clips of their (now dead) dog, set to inapproriate lighthearted music. 
I find the latter software to be much user-friendly. Can I do that?

The X-Men I just want to get not talk politics for one post and actually discuss shit that this sub was meant for In the past week, two major events occurred that seemed like a fitting end to the 2010’s. On April 25, Avengers Endgame was released. I’m not going to spoil it, but every character in the MCU had a role and in general, it acted as a great conclusion to 11 years of MCU movies (Iron Man being released in 2008). That’s all I am going to say about that as I know people want to see the movie witho. So after Nasu's earlier interview, people are up in arms about ZOMG NASU SAID HE'S ENDING FGO AFTER PART 2!!!1! . First off. Calm down. Breath. It's just a mobile game. But even if it wasn't, this is all just a spook and fear mongering. Let me count the reasons why and debunk some bullshit (especially considering there are reddit trolls like https://www.reddit.com/user/SantanaKick trying to fearmonger) so you feel at ease during your pillar-farming new year. Fate/Grand Order makes I have written the post Fixing Movie Licensed Video Games (https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/a8kbph/fixing_movie_licensed_video_games/) a few months ago and won the Best Fixing Video Game 2018. Since the pitch about what to do with movie-licensed video games garnered so much attention, with upcoming new Doom movie, I feel this is a good time to discuss video game-licensed movies, aka, video game movie. Adapting a video game into the movie is a significantly difficult I decided to gather all of the important article links in one post, so everyone can easily reach it. I wanted to vary the sources and give more direct quotes from Kojima and Kojima Productions themselves so people wouldn't misquote them or anything. I think people would find this useful since there's quite a few times when people just randomly take an interest in Death Stranding and don't really know what to look for to get to know more about it so yeah, a post compiling all the news would. Adapting a video game into the movie is a significantly difficult task than making a game out of a movie. In the case of movie-licensed games, they mostly suck because of the lack of development time, inexperienced developer team, and especially the publisher's demand to chase a trend in the gaming industry rather than adapting the movie's core concept into the interactive form. I listed Harry Potter games, Mad Max, and Ghostbusters as examples of failing optimization of their
